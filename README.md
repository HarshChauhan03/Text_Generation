This project demonstrates **AI-based Text Generation** using a pre-trained GPT-2 Transformer model.

The system takes a user prompt as input and generates coherent, human-like text continuation.

## 📌 Project Overview

Text Generation is a core task in Generative AI where models learn patterns in language and generate meaningful content.

This project uses:

- GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2)
- HuggingFace Transformers library
- Pretrained language model
- Prompt-based text generation

Unlike rule-based systems, this model generates creative and context-aware text dynamically.

## 🧠 What is GPT-2?

GPT-2 is a Transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI.

Key Features:

- Autoregressive text generation  
- Trained on large-scale internet text data  
- Generates human-like paragraphs  
- Understands context from previous words  

GPT-2 predicts the next word based on previous words in a sequence.
